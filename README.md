**üìì We no longer store instruction files in this repository.**

Now all the necessary information is in a single [interactive document "üõ∞Ô∏è MYSAT GUIDE"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/146EPTvLMzydpwUMsbJWAC3gcRO6yPDe3p8kIpxRUwU4/edit?tab=t.0) :
- start-up guide;
- firmware update guide;
- body assembly guide;
- troubleshooting;
- documentation.

This online document is maintained and will continue to be updated.

üìµ Unfortunately, Google Documents are displayed incorrectly when using mobile devices, especially without the official application installed.

Solution: 
- use a PC (recommended);
- download the official Google Docs mobile application;
- download the necessary pages of the guide in PDF format and read them as files.

We are working on a solution to the problem of adaptability.
